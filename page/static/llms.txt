# Observability Hub - Project Overview

A resilient, self-hosted observability platform engineered for high-fidelity telemetry and GitOps-driven state reconciliation.

## Candidate Profile
- **Developer:** Victoria Cheng (Software Developer)
- **Specialization:** Distributed Systems, Cloud-Native Orchestration, Observability.
- **Background:** Transitioned from physical engineering to software development, bringing a rigor for measurement and reliability (Prev at Shopify).
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/victoriacheng15

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Go (1.26+)
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K3s)
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry (Traces, Metrics, Logs), Prometheus, Grafana, Tempo, Loki.
- **Infrastructure:** OpenTofu (IaC), OpenBao (Secret Management), Systemd (Host Collectors).
- **Data:** PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB/PostGIS).

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Strangler Fig Migration:** Phased migration from Docker-compose/Systemd to Kubernetes (K3s) with zero downtime.
- **Pure Wrapper Architecture:** Standardized Go libraries for telemetry and DB connections to ensure architectural consistency.
- **Unified Collectors:** Resource-optimized host-level telemetry reducing idle consumption by 80%.

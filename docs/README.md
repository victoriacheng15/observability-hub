# Documentation Hub

This directory is the central repository for all technical knowledge and institutional memory for the **Observability Hub**.

The Hub operates on a hybrid model: **Host-tier** services handle hardware and security, while the **Cluster-tier** (k3s) manages the observability data platform.

## 🛠️ Process & Standards

Incident documentation prevents recurrence and builds system resilience.

### ⚖️ When to write an RCA (The Rule of Three)

Formal RCAs are required only if **one or more** of these conditions are met:

1. **Utility Loss**: Failure to fulfill primary purpose (e.g., dashboards inaccessible, telemetry collection halted).
2. **Data Integrity**: Permanent loss, corruption, or unauthorized exposure of data.
3. **Regression (The "Zombie Bug")**: The failure has occurred previously. Identification of the gap in the previous fix is required.

*Minor configuration drifts or "noisy" logs that do not impact system health should be handled via standard Git commit documentation rather than an RCA.*

### Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🔴 High** | Service down, data loss, or security breach. |
| **🟡 Medium** | Partial degradation, performance issues, or feature malfunction. |
| **🔵 Low** | Minor bugs, cosmetic issues, or non-critical failures. |

### Status

| Status | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🚧 Investigating** | Identifying the root cause. |
| **🩹 Mitigated** | Temporary fix applied, service restored. |
| **✅ Resolved** | Root cause identified and permanent fix implemented. |

### 📝 RCA Template

To document a new incident, create a new file named `XXX-descriptive-title.md`.

```markdown
# RCA [XXX]: [Descriptive Title]

- **Status:** Investigating | Mitigated | Resolved
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Severity:** High | Medium | Low
- **Author:** Victoria Cheng
